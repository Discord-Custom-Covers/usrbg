## Importing the Database

```css
@import url('https://discord-custom-covers.github.io/usrbg/dist/usrbg.css');
```

This will import the USRBG database. Alone, it's simply some variables. Some of examples on how it can be utilized can be seen in the [Snippets](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg/tree/master/snippets) folder of this repo.

## Important
If you are using BetterDiscord, you MUST have a plugin by devilbro running, as USRBG requires his lib for certain important data attributes. I've been nagging zere for while to add attributes to BD natively, but for the time being this is how we have to do it. 

## Approved Request Locations
All requests are processed manually by a select few theme developers (as of right now). You should expect to wait a short amount of time before your background is added.
(note that you may also request a background through a pull request on this repo)
